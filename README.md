# DONKIDataSorter
For my summer internship, I am working with data from the [Space Weather Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (DONKI)](https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/), developed at the [Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC)](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/). This data is provided for free online in the format of a JSON array, so this program takes that data and orginizes it so only the most useful parts are provided.
